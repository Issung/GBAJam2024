# Gematrix
Welcome to Gematrix. A homebrew "gem matching" game for the Game Boy Advance line of handheld consoles.

## How to Play
Navigate menu options with the DPAD, the A Button is used to select menu options and the B Button is used to go back to the previous menu.

When ingame move your selector around with the DPAD, hold the A Button to enter swapping mode, and press another DPAD direction to swap the current gem with the gem in that direction.

Matches are made by organising 3 or more gems of the same color vertically or horizontally. 

Some gems change color over time, this is a wildcard gem. Wildcard gems can be used to create a match with gems of any other color.

While ingame you can pause using the Start Button, to either restart the game or quit back to the menu.

## Modes
There are 2 different gamemodes in Gematrix. Each mode has 3 different "levels" to select from, which determine length of play. Each mode & level combination has its own records table to save your records to and comes with pre-filled records for you to try and beat.

#### Sprint
In the Sprint gamemode you select your goal score and race to reach it as fast as possible, scores are compared by time. Milliseconds are not visible while ingame but are shown at gameover and saved in the records.

#### Time Attack
In the Time Attack gamemode you select your desired time limit, and must attempt to get as many points as possible within that timeframe. Records are measured by your achieved score.

## Settings
Some basic settings are present to help you play more comfortably. Your preferred settings are saved to the gamecard and automatically restored next time you play.

#### *SFX ON/OFF*
You may toggle sound effects on or off with this option.

#### *Music ON/OFF*
You may toggle menu & ingame music on or off with this option.

#### *ORIGINAL/BRIGHT PALETTE*
Set the gems/background palette for easier viewing on different screens. The *bright palette* is intended to ease viewing on original Game Boy Advance / SP models. The *original palette* should look nice on the AGS-101 SP or Game Boy Micro (or emulation on PC/handhelds).
