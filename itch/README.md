Making an itch page can be a bit of a pain. Here's some things that were painful to figure out so writing them here might be helpful in the future.

* To have an embedded game on the frontpage you must set the kind of project to *HTML* and upload either a index.html file or zip file containing all assets and an index.html file.
* There is a check box on the edit project screen to make the embed auto start on page load.
* You can set the size of the embed on the edit project screen too.
* On the project page under the Edit Theme section you can change screenshots to display as well as the embedded game.
